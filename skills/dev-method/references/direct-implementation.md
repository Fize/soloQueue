# Direct Implementation

> **Module loaded by `dev-method`.** Use this when formal method overhead (TDD/BDD/API-First/Security-First) is not justified by the task complexity.

## YOU ARE BOUND BY THIS CONTRACT

You are NOT a general-purpose assistant while this method is active. You are a Direct Implementation agent operating under a lightweight contract.

**Read this contract aloud to yourself before taking any action:**

> I will NOT implement without first confirming the change is truly trivial or exploratory.
> I will NOT skip the minimal checks below — they exist to prevent careless mistakes.
> I will NOT add features, fallbacks, or error handling the user did NOT explicitly request.
> I inherit all common discipline rules from [common-discipline.md](common-discipline.md).

**These are not suggestions.** Breaking any of them means you are not using this method — you are ignoring it.

## When to Use Direct Implementation

| Task Type                            | Example                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple CRUD endpoint                 | `POST /users` with basic validation                              |
| Prototype / spike                    | "Let me try this approach quickly"                                |
| Exploratory / PoC                    | "Can we prove this concept works?"                                |
| Trivial change (confirmed)           | Single-line fix, typo, missing import                            |
| Config / documentation changes       | Updating a settings file, adding a README section                 |
| One-to-one mapping / boilerplate     | Adding a new field that mirrors an existing pattern               |

**When NOT to use Direct Implementation:**

- Business logic with edge cases → use **TDD**
- User-facing behavior with acceptance criteria → use **BDD**
- Multi-team API design → use **API-First**
- Sensitive data / auth / payment → use **Security-First**

If in doubt, use a formal method. Direct Implementation is the exception, not the default.

## MANDATORY RULES (Violation = Method Failure)

> **Common discipline rules** (English Only, No Assumptions, Clarify First, Do EXACTLY, Research First, No Over-Engineering, Comments Explain WHY, Evidence Required) are inherited from [common-discipline.md](common-discipline.md). Violating any of them = method failure.

| #   | Rule                                                                                              | NEVER Do This                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Confirm Scope First** — MUST confirm with the user that the change qualifies as direct impl     | Assuming a task is trivial without checking                     |
| 2   | **Check Existing Code** — MUST search for existing similar code before writing new code            | Writing a new function when one already exists in the codebase  |
| 3   | **Run Existing Tests** — MUST run existing tests after making changes and show the output          | Making changes without verifying nothing broke                  |
| 4   | **Input Validation Required** — If the change handles external input, validation is NOT optional   | Accepting raw `request.body` without validation                 |
| 5   | **Error Handling Required** — If the change interacts with external systems, error handling is NOT optional | Ignoring potential network/DB errors                            |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Confirm Scope

Ask the user to confirm this is a direct implementation task:

```markdown
## Scope Confirmation

This change appears to be [describe: simple CRUD / prototype / trivial fix / config change].

I plan to use **Direct Implementation** — no formal TDD/BDD cycle, but I will:
- Check for existing similar code
- Run existing tests
- Add validation if handling external input

Is this appropriate, or would you prefer a formal method (TDD / BDD / API-First / Security-First)?
```

If the user says "use a formal method" → switch to the appropriate method from [common-discipline.md](common-discipline.md).

### Step 2: Research Existing Code

Quick search before implementing:

```bash
# Search for similar functionality
Grep pattern="<relevant pattern>"

# Check existing patterns
Grep pattern="<similar function/class name>"
```

Present findings briefly:

```markdown
## Quick Research

- [ ] No similar code found → writing new
- [x] Found: `<file/path>` — `<brief description>`
      → Reusing? YES / NO — reason: `<reason>`
```

### Step 3: Implement

Write the code. Follow these rules:

- Keep it simple. No abstractions unless the codebase already has them.
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the file you're modifying.
- Add comments for WHY, not WHAT.
- If handling external input → add validation.
- If interacting with external systems → add error handling.

### Step 4: Verify

Run existing tests:

```bash
# Run the relevant test suite
<test command>

# Show output
```

If tests fail → fix before proceeding.

### Step 5: Return to Calling Context

- If called from `fullstack-dev`: return to the scenario flow. Report what was done and the next step.
- If called directly: output a summary (what was implemented, test results, files modified) and ask if there's a next step.

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using Direct for complex logic      | "I'll just code it directly" for business rules           | Switch to TDD or BDD                                          |
| Skipping existing code check        | Writing a new HTTP client when one exists                 | Search first, reuse existing                                   |
| No test verification                | Making changes without running tests                      | Run existing tests and show output                             |
| Skipping validation on input        | Accepting user input without checks "because it's simple" | Validation is always required for external input               |
| Scope creep during direct impl      | "While I'm here, let me also..."                          | Do ONLY what was asked                                         |

## Refusal Script

→ See [common-discipline.md](common-discipline.md) for the common refusal script. Use "Direct Implementation" as the method name.

Additionally, if the task turns out to be more complex than expected:

> This task is more complex than initially assessed. Direct Implementation is no longer appropriate. I recommend switching to **[TDD/BDD/API-First/Security-First]** because [reason]. Would you like me to switch methods?
