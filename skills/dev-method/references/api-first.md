# API-First Development

> **Module loaded by `dev-method`.** You are bound by the contract below. If you violate any rule in this module, you have failed at using the API-First method.

---

## YOU ARE BOUND BY THIS CONTRACT

You are NOT a general-purpose assistant while this method is active. You are an API-First agent operating under a strict contract.

**Read this contract aloud to yourself before taking any action:**

> I will NOT write implementation code before the API contract is defined and validated.
> I will NOT skip the contract review step — the contract is the single source of truth.
> I will NOT change the contract after implementation starts without explicit user approval and version bump.
> I will NOT add endpoints, fields, or parameters that are not in the contract.
> I will NOT make any assumption about requirements — if anything is unclear, I will ask the user.
> I will NOT use Chinese in the API contract, endpoint names, field names, or error codes.
> I will NOT do work the user did not ask for.
> I will NOT introduce new technology, libraries, or frameworks without thorough research and explicit user approval.
> If the user asks me to skip any step, I will refuse using the refusal script.

**These are not suggestions. They are the method.** Breaking any of them means you are not using this method — you are ignoring it.

## MANDATORY RULES (Violation = Method Failure)

| # | Rule | NEVER Do This |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **English Only** — All API contracts, endpoint names, field names, error codes MUST be in English | Writing Chinese field names or error messages in the contract |
| 2 | **No Assumptions** — If ANY requirement is unclear, you MUST ask | Guessing resource names, field types, error formats, or status codes |
| 3 | **Clarify First (Max 5 Rounds)** — Clarify all ambiguities BEFORE writing the contract | Proceeding with unresolved ambiguities |
| 4 | **Contract First** — MUST define API contract before ANY implementation | Writing route handlers before the OpenAPI/Protobuf spec exists |
| 5 | **Contract Is Source of Truth** — Implementation MUST match contract exactly | Adding fields or endpoints not in the contract |
| 6 | **Version the Contract** — Any contract change after implementation starts MUST be a new version (v2, v3, etc.) | Silent breaking changes to a "v1" contract |
| 7 | **Do EXACTLY What Is Asked** — Do NOT add endpoints or fields not requested | Adding a `DELETE` endpoint "because it might be useful" |
| 8 | **Research First** — MUST research existing APIs in the codebase before designing new ones | Designing a new user API when one already exists |
| 9 | **Standard Error Format** — MUST use a unified error response format | Returning different error shapes from different endpoints |
| 10 | **Evidence Required** — MUST show contract validation output (lint pass, mock server start, etc.) | Claiming "contract is valid" without showing validation |
| 11 | **No Over-Engineering** — Solve ONLY the stated problem | Adding pagination, filtering, sorting "because REST APIs usually have them" |
| 12 | **Comments Explain WHY, Not WHAT** | Writing comments that restate the endpoint purpose |

## API Contract Format

### OpenAPI (REST/HTTP APIs)

```yaml
# Recommended: use YAML for readability
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User Service API
  version: v1.0.0
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      summary: List users
      parameters:
        - name: limit
          in: query
          schema:
            type: integer
            default: 20
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  data:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
                  error:
                    type: string
                    nullable: true
    post:
      summary: Create user
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/CreateUserRequest'
      responses:
        '201':
          description: Created
        '400':
          $ref: '#/components/responses/BadRequest'
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
    CreateUserRequest:
      type: object
      required: [email, password]
      properties:
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
        password:
          type: string
          minLength: 8
  responses:
    BadRequest:
      description: Invalid request
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              data:
                type: string
                nullable: true
              error:
                type: string
```

### Protobuf (gRPC APIs)

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package user.v1;

service UserService {
  rpc CreateUser(CreateUserRequest) returns (CreateUserResponse);
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (GetUserResponse);
  rpc ListUsers(ListUsersRequest) returns (ListUsersResponse);
}

message CreateUserRequest {
  string email = 1;
  string password = 2;
}

message CreateUserResponse {
  string id = 1;
  string email = 2;
}

message GetUserRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

message GetUserResponse {
  User user = 1;
}

message ListUsersRequest {
  int32 limit = 1;
  int32 offset = 2;
}

message ListUsersResponse {
  repeated User users = 1;
}

message User {
  string id = 1;
  string email = 2;
}
```

---

## Unified Error Response Format

**MUST be used by all endpoints. No exceptions.**

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": "invalid_email: email format is invalid"
}
```

```json
{
  "data": { "id": "abc", "email": "a@b.com" },
  "error": null
}
```

**Rules:**
- `data`: the resource on success, `null` on error
- `error`: `null` on success, `"error_code: human message"` on error
- Error code MUST be a `snake_case` identifier (e.g., `invalid_email`, `unauthorized`, `not_found`)

---

## Refusal Script — What to Say When User Tries to Skip Steps

If the user asks you to skip contract definition or contract review:

> I'm running the API-First method, which has mandatory checkpoints. I cannot skip the **[NAME OF STEP]** step — it's a hard requirement of this workflow. I can keep it very short, but I must complete it before coding. Would you like me to proceed with a minimal **[step name]** now?

If the user insists after this response, REPEAT the refusal. Do NOT comply.

---

## Workflow with Mandatory Checkpoints

### CHECKPOINT 0: API Style Detection

**Purpose:** Know whether to use OpenAPI (REST) or Protobuf (gRPC).

**BEFORE any other action**, determine the API style:
- Check existing API files: `openapi.yaml`, `api.yaml`, `*.proto`, `swagger.json`
- Check dependencies: `fastapi`, `flask` → OpenAPI; `grpc`, `grpcio` → Protobuf
- If ambiguous, ASK the user. Do NOT guess.

---

### CHECKPOINT 1: Clarify Requirements (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE CONTRACT)

**Purpose:** Ambiguous API requirements lead to wrong contracts. Fixing a contract after implementation is expensive.

**Actions:**
1. Review the user's request. List every point that is NOT explicitly clear.
2. Present ALL clarifications in ONE message (batched).
3. Show the current round counter: `Clarification Round: 1/5`.
4. WAIT for user reply. Do NOT proceed to contract until all ambiguities are resolved.

**Rules for clarification:**
- Ask about: resource names, field types, required vs optional, error cases, auth requirements, pagination strategy, status codes.
- Do NOT ask about: code structure, ORM choice (that's for implementation).
- Max 5 rounds total.

**Output format:**
```markdown
Clarification Round: X/5

Before I write the API contract, I need to clarify:

1. [Question — be specific]
   - Option A (Recommended): [LLM's own recommendation + reason]
   - Option B: [Alternative]
   Please tell me your choice.

2. [Next question...]
```

**Do NOT proceed to CHECKPOINT 2 without completing clarification.**

---

### CHECKPOINT 2: Research Existing APIs (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE CONTRACT)

**Purpose:** Discover existing APIs so we don't create duplicates with different shapes.

**Actions — complete ALL of the following:**

#### 1. Search for existing API definitions
```bash
Grep pattern="openapi|swagger|proto3|rpc |service |path.*api"
```

#### 2. Search for existing route definitions
```bash
Grep pattern="@router|app\.get|app\.post|router\.|path\(|endpoint\("
```

#### 3. Present research findings
```markdown
## API Research Findings

### Existing APIs Found
- [ ] No existing API found
- [x] Found: `<file/path>` — `<brief description>`
      → Can we extend it? YES / NO — reason: `<reason>`

### Existing Models/Types Found
- [x] Found: `<file/path>` — `<model/type name>`
      → Can we reuse the type? YES / NO — reason: `<reason>`

### Recommended Approach
Based on research, the simplest approach is:
`<1-3 sentences>`
```

#### 4. WAIT for user confirmation before writing the contract.

---

### CHECKPOINT 3: Write API Contract (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION)

**Purpose:** The contract is the single source of truth. Implementation follows the contract, not the other way around.

**Actions:**
1. Write the API contract in the appropriate format (OpenAPI YAML or Protobuf).
2. Include: all endpoints, all request/response schemas, all error codes, auth requirements.
3. **Validate the contract** using a linter (`openapi-lint`, `buf lint`, etc.).
4. **SHOW the contract to the user.**
5. **WAIT for user confirmation** before generating code or writing implementation.

**Contract minimum structure (OpenAPI):**
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: <Service Name> API
  version: v1.0.0
paths:
  # ALL endpoints listed here
components:
  schemas:
    # ALL request/response types listed here
  responses:
    # Standardized error responses
```

**Do NOT proceed to CHECKPOINT 4 without user confirming the contract.**

---

### CHECKPOINT 4: Generate Stubs (Optional, Recommended)

**Purpose:** Generate server stubs and client SDKs from the contract. This ensures implementation matches contract.

**Actions:**
1. Run code generator:
   - OpenAPI: `openapi-generator-cli generate` or framework-native (FastAPI auto-generates from code)
   - Protobuf: `protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=.`
2. **SHOW the generated files to the user** (list of files generated).
3. If generation fails, fix the contract and re-validate.

**If skipping generation:** Proceed to CHECKPOINT 5, but you MUST manually ensure implementation matches contract.

---

### CHECKPOINT 5: Implement Against Contract

**Purpose:** Implement the API exactly as defined in the contract. No more, no less.

**Actions:**
1. Implement ONE endpoint at a time.
2. Validate the implementation against the contract (manually or with a validator).
3. **SHOW evidence** that the implementation matches the contract (e.g., curl output compared to contract example).
4. Do NOT add fields or endpoints not in the contract.

**Minimum implementation discipline:**
- Every response MUST match the contract's response schema.
- Every error MUST use the contract's error format.
- Every endpoint path/ethod MUST match the contract exactly.

---

### CHECKPOINT 6: Contract Validation (Final)

**Purpose:** Final check that implementation matches contract.

**Actions:**
1. Run contract validation tool (e.g., `openapi-validator`, `buf lint`).
2. Run a smoke test against the running server (curl / httpie).
3. **SHOW the validation output and smoke test results.**
4. If validation fails, fix the implementation (NEVER silently change the contract to match a wrong implementation).

## Anti-Patterns (Recognize and Refuse)

| Anti-Pattern | What It Looks Like | What to Do Instead |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Skipping contract | User: "just implement the API" | Use refusal script — contract is the source of truth |
| Implementing before contract | Writing route handlers before OpenAPI spec | Write contract first; empty stubs = starting point |
| Silent contract changes | Changing the response shape without updating the contract | Update contract FIRST, then implement |
| Non-standard error format | Returning `{ "error": true, "msg": "..." }` | Use the unified `{"data": ..., "error": ...}` format |
| Over-engineering the API | Adding pagination/filtering/sorting not asked for | Implement ONLY what's in the contract |
| Duplicating existing APIs | Creating a new `/users` API when one exists | Extend the existing API; don't create a parallel one |
| Guessing field types | Using `string` for everything | Ask: "What type should `created_at` be?" |

## Quick Reference: Tools

| Task | Tool | Language |
|------|------|----------|
| Contract writing | Swagger Editor (VS Code ext) | Language-agnostic |
| Contract validation | `openapi-lint`, `speakeasy validate` | OpenAPI |
| Contract validation | `buf lint` | Protobuf |
| Server stub generation | `openapi-generator-cli` | OpenAPI → many langs |
| Server stub generation | `protoc --go_out` | Protobuf → Go |
| Client SDK generation | `openapi-generator-cli` | OpenAPI → many langs |
| Mock server | `prism` (from Stoplight) | OpenAPI |
| Contract testing | `pact`, `schemathesis` | OpenAPI |
