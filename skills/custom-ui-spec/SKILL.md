name: custom-ui-spec
description: A highly customizable UI design specification system based on headless component libraries (shadcn/ui, Radix UI), integrating Apple HIG, Microsoft Fluent, and Google Material Design. Unlike using off-the-shelf frameworks (Ant Design, Element Plus), this skill is for scenarios requiring full control over component styles and DOM structure, emphasizing design freedom and brand customization. Use when: generating custom UI code, reviewing custom UI designs, or needing to follow platform-specific design guidelines. Supports HIG / Fluent / Material / All specification modes. Keywords: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, headless, custom components, HIG, Fluent, Material Design.

# Custom UI Spec

## Overview

This skill provides strict definitions for the three major design specifications — Apple HIG, Microsoft Fluent, and Google Material Design — to guide highly customizable UI implementations based on headless component libraries like shadcn/ui and Radix UI.

Unlike scenarios using off-the-shelf UI frameworks (e.g., TDesign), this skill is for projects that require full control over component anatomy and styling, emphasizing design freedom, brand customization, and cross-platform design consistency.

## Specification Selection Decision Tree

**Dimension A: Target Platform (default recommendation)**

| Platform | Recommended Spec | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / iPadOS / macOS / watchOS / tvOS | HIG | Native Apple ecosystem experience |
| Windows / Xbox | Fluent | Native Microsoft ecosystem experience |
| Android / Web / Flutter | Material | Native Google ecosystem experience |
| Cross-platform / Unsure | Ask about design tone preference | See Dimension B |

**Dimension B: Design Tone Preference (when platform is unclear)**

| Design Tone | Recommended Spec | Typical Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| Refined, native, restrained, layered | HIG | Utility apps, productivity software, Apple ecosystem products |
| Productive, professional, deep, luminous | Fluent | Enterprise software, office suites, Windows ecosystem products |
| Bold, graphical, tactile, dynamic | Material | Consumer apps, creative products, Google ecosystem products |

**Decision Flow:**

```
User specified a spec explicitly?
├── Yes → Use the specified spec directly
└── No → User specified a target platform?
    ├── Yes → Recommend per Dimension A
    └── No → Ask about design tone preference (Dimension B)
        └── User chooses "All" → Comprehensive cross-check (flag cross-spec conflicts)
```

## Usage Modes

### Generation Mode

Before generating UI code:
1. Determine the target spec using the decision tree
2. Read the corresponding `references/<spec>.md` for the complete specification
3. Implement compliant styles using headless components like shadcn/ui
4. Run `scripts/validate_ui.py` for automated validation
5. Self-check against `references/checklist.md` item by item
6. Output the validation report

### Review Mode

When reviewing existing UI code/design:
1. Determine the target spec based on code characteristics or user input
2. Run `scripts/validate_ui.py` for automated static analysis
3. Cross-check against `references/checklist.md` item by item
4. Output the validation report (Pass / Warning / Error)

## Validation Flow

Three-step validation:

1. **Automated check**: Run `scripts/validate_ui.py --spec <hig|fluent|material> --file <path>` or `--text <code>`
2. **Manual self-check**: Agent cross-checks against `references/checklist.md` item by item
3. **Report output**: Combine automated results and manual review into a structured validation report

Color checks are skipped by default. Add `--check-color` to enable them.
