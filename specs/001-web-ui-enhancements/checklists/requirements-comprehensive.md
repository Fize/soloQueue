# Comprehensive Requirements Quality Checklist: Web UI Enhancements for Agent Output & Interaction

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurability of requirements across all feature areas (UX/UI, security/approval, data/storage, integration)
**Created**: 2026-02-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are write-action confirmation dialog requirements complete (file path, operation type, agent name, approve/reject buttons)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, FR-013]
- [ ] CHK002 Are agent output differentiation requirements complete (thinking content, tool calls, final results blocks)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK003 Are collapsible thinking content requirements complete (collapsed by default, preview snippet, expand/collapse controls)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, FR-011, FR-012]
- [ ] CHK004 Are agent color assignment requirements complete (color field, default palette, uniqueness)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, FR-009]
- [ ] CHK005 Are font size increase requirements complete (base font size 14px, dialogs and message panels)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK006 Are artifact storage requirements complete (directory path, auto creation, duplicate handling)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, FR-007, FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Are timeout requirements for write-action confirmations explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 Is "base font size of at least 14px" clearly defined for all dialogs and message panels? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "unique, consistent color" clearly defined with respect to agent configuration and fallback palette? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK010 Is "preview snippet (e.g., first 200 characters)" clearly defined for collapsed thinking content? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK011 Is "thinking content blocks collapsible/expandable via user-clickable controls" clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK012 Are "artifact directory automatically created" requirements clear about permissions and error handling? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK013 Is "deterministic palette rotation" defined for color assignment when no custom color specified? [Gap]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK014 Are color assignment requirements consistent between FR-004 (unique color per agent) and FR-009 (optional color field)? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK015 Are thinking content requirements consistent across FR-002 (separate blocks), FR-003 (collapsible), FR-011 (collapsed by default), and FR-012 (preview snippet)? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK016 Are write-action confirmation requirements consistent across FR-001 (display in web UI), FR-010 (no timeout), and FR-013 (information displayed)? [Consistency]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 Is SC-001 measurable (within 2 seconds of request appearing)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK018 Is SC-002 measurable (100% of agent output blocks distinguishable, zero ambiguity)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK019 Is SC-003 measurable (90% of users successful on first attempt)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK020 Is SC-004 measurable (WCAG 2.1 Level AA verified by automated scan)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK021 Is SC-005 measurable (100% of artifacts stored correctly after 50 test runs)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-005]
- [ ] CHK022 Is SC-006 measurable (task-completion time decrease by at least 30%)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are primary user scenarios covered in User Stories 1-4? [Coverage]
- [ ] CHK024 Are alternate flows covered (e.g., user rejects write action)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK025 Are exception flows covered (e.g., WebSocket disconnection, duplicate filenames)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are recovery flows covered (e.g., reconnection after offline)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK027 Are edge cases defined for identical agent colors? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK028 Are edge cases defined for extremely long thinking content? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK029 Are edge cases defined for duplicate artifact filenames? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK030 Are edge cases defined for offline user? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK031 Are performance requirements defined (page-load time increase ≤10%, UI responsive under 500ms)? [Non-Functional, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Are security requirements defined (user approval gates, path validation)? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-001, FR-010]
- [ ] CHK033 Are accessibility requirements defined (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK034 Are backward compatibility requirements defined (terminal logging remains)? [Non-Functional, Spec §Assumptions]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK035 Are assumptions about color assignment documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK036 Are assumptions about font size increase documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
